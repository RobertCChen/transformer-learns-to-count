failed_rnn,lstm,transformer trained for 50, 35, 20 epochs, resp. 
failed_rnn converged to 1 accuracy in 28 epochs, lstm in 13, transformer in 8.
failed_rnn doesn't generalize and exhibits the "bad" state dynamics described in can_rnns_count paper.
See model_storage/model_rnn for an rnn that does generalize and has "good" state dynamics
lstm generalize
transformer generalizes. both model_storage/model_transtormer and ./m_transformer have
similar state dynamics, namely, spiral mv't on `a`, linearly move toward attracting point upon `b`.
